# Scrape_Youtube_Video_Info-Comments
This code is to Scrape the information of the YouTube Video name + Likes + Date published.<br>
For the comments of the video, it contains the comment itself + Comment Date(year) + Likes(Only int).<br>
It is run with the selenium.

# Translate non-Enlgish comment to Englsih(Updated)
To do the research, it better to unify the language of the comment.<br>
So I added code to identifing if the comment is English and translate it to Enlgish if it is non-Enlgish comment.
